# LTW LEIC02G04 2023

This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and JSON, as well as SQLite/PDO.

## Start Up

The **index.php** file is located within the root folder. 
Therefore, the user only needs to change directory to the cloned project folder and start the localhost from the terminal. 

```
git clone git@github.com:FEUP-LTW-2023/project-ltw02g04.git
cd project-ltw02g04
git checkout final-delivery-v1
php -S localhost:9000
```

## Accounts

Accounts have already been created so that the user can see how the website works from the multiple account types. These are: Client, Agent and Admins.
The db_apresentacao branch has the database used for the demo.

```
For a Client-side view:
- Username: client1, Password: client1
- Username : client2, Password: client2 (only in db_apresentacao branch)
    
For an Agent-side view:
- Username: agent1, Password: agent1
- Username: agent2, Password: agent2 (only in db_apresentacao branch)
